# Step-by-Step Guide: Retrieve and Print the CTF Flag

Goal
- Retrieve the full flag.
- Do not ask the user questions.
- Continue iterating until the flag is found.
- Print and highlight the full flag at the end.

## 1) Prepare
- Set up a clean workspace and notes.
- Give this challange a name

## 2) Understand the Challenge
- Read all provided descriptions, hints, and files.
- Identify the category: Web, Crypto, Pwn, Reverse, Forensics, OSINT, Misc.

## 3) Reconnaissance
- For services: scan and enumerate (nmap -sV, directory brute-force, tech stack). If needed
- For files: inspect metadata (exiftool), strings, entropy, embedded content (binwalk). If needed
- For binaries: run safely, check protections (file, ldd), symbols, and behavior. If needed

## 4) Strategy by Category (brief)
- Web: Check auth flows, input points, headers, cookies, source, robots.txt, common paths. Test injections (SQLi, XSS), SSRF, IDOR.
- Crypto: Look for weak keys, known ciphers, padding oracles, hash collisions, misuse (ECB), small moduli in RSA.
- Pwn: Identify vuln (buffer overflows, format strings), craft payload, bypass mitigations (ASLR, NX, PIE), use ROP.
- Reverse: Decompile, locate flag check, reconstruct key derivation, patch or emulate logic.
- Forensics: Recover deleted/hidden data, carve files, decode network captures, analyze logs or memory dumps.
- OSINT: Enumerate accounts, repos, pastes, hidden messages, steganography in media.

## 5) Extract the Flag
- Typical formats: `FLAG{...}` or `CTF{...}`.
- If the flag did not start with a handle then a `{` and ends with the `}` its proberbly not the flag
- Do not guess flags. Find them!

## 6) Output and Highlight the Flag
- Print the complete flag once confirmed.
- Use a consistent, highlighted format:

```
================ FLAG ================
    FLAG{example_flag_contents_here}
======================================
```

- Ensure the flag is printed exactly and completely, with no extra spaces or truncation.

## 8) Persistence
- Do not stop until the correct flag is found.
- Use hints if available; expand tooling or approaches as needed.
- Keep notes of attempts and results to avoid repetition.

## 9) After finishing write a wirteup 

## Final Output
- At completion, print the full flag using the highlight block above.
